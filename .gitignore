# Data
*.csv
# Keep supermarket_sales.csv if intended for repo, but usually data is ignored. 
# Prompt said "Users should download their own or use the demo", but also "use the demo" implies demo data is in repo. 
# I will ignore other CSVs but allow supermarket_sales.csv if it's the demo.
# Actually, strict instruction: "*.csv (Users should download their own or use the demo)."
# If I ignore *.csv, the demo file in repo will be ignored by git.
# I will allow supermarket_sales.csv explicitly.
