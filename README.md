## Description

The "Super Market Sales Prediction" project is a machine learning-based application that predicts super market sales based on various features such as branch, city, customer type, gender, product line, unit price, quantity, tax, cost of goods sold, gross income, and customer rating. This project demonstrates the use of multiple regression algorithms to make sales predictions.

Key features of the project include:
- Preprocessing and encoding of categorical features.
- Training and evaluation of different regression models.
- Visualization of model performance.

## Models and Evaluation

The project utilizes various regression models, including:
- XGBoost Regressor
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Ridge Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- MLP Regressor
- LightGBM Regressor
- Lasso Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- CatBoost Regressor

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
